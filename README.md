## üìù Description

Sigma Cars is a car rental application. This is a learning
project that was created to practice and demonstrate the development of a full stack web application. Users can search
for cars by location, price, and availability, and make reservations for the selected car.

- Sigma Cars is containerized using **Docker**, providing easy deployments and scalability.
- The backend is developed using **ASP.NET Core**, a high-performance framework, and utilizes a **PostgreSQL** database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- The website is built using **Nuxt** and **Vue**, resulting in an interactive and visually appealing user interface. It is developed with a focus on type-safety by using **TypeScript**
- Project utilizes an **Nginx** proxy server, which acts as a reverse proxy, handling incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate services.
- This repository leverages **GitHub Actions** to automate the **CI/CD** process. This ensures that up-to-date images are pushed to **Docker Hub**, making it easy to deploy the latest version of the project.
- Users can choose to access the system via the **REST API** documented by **OpenAPI** schema, allowing programmatic interactions, or use the website for a user-friendly graphical interface.
